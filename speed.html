<h3>Introduction</h3>
<img src="images/speed.jpg" alt="Page Speed" class="img-fluid" title="Page Speed"> <br><br>

		  
		  
		  		  <p>When developing a website, it is important to understand the reasoning behind page speed. When a person visits a website, they are looking for fast results without a lot of clutter hiding the content. Slow page speeds tend to inform viewers that a lot of things are likely to be loading and that they can go back and find their solution faster than waiting. Google crawls web pages to determine if the speed is within an acceptable range or not and low performance websites get pushed down on listings compared to those better designed with the user in mind. While page speed is only a single factor when determining you search rank, it is one to consider high on the list. Google is the #1 ranked website, so it would make sense to use their speed tester, which is available <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" title="Insights">here</a>. </p>

<h3>Inside your &#8249;<em>head</em>&#8250; </h3>
<img src="images/render.jpg" alt="Render" class="img-fluid" title="Render"> <br>
		  
		  
		  		  <p>The &#8249;<em>head</em>&#8250; element of your page can slow your website down in several ways due to synchronously loading the information, for now, lets talk about images, stylesheets, and scripts. Images are often called from css and javascript when the browser begins loading a page due to the information in the head. Calling for external files can drag you down and it is important to know the order in which testers prefer you load it. The fastest way to load css infomation from external files is to simply place it inline as it is used in the &#8249;<em>body</em>&#8250; of the html file, thus eliminating the call in the first place. While this isn't always possible, you have alternative methods. You could place a &#8249;<em>style</em>&#8250; element right inside of the &#8249;<em>head</em>&#8250; element and write your css on page. These methods load faster than external files but sometimes your scripts or styles alone are larger than the html file itself and its up to you to decide whats best. When using an external scripts,  you can load them using the <em>async</em> attribute, meaning it loads up after more priority items load first.</p>

<h3>Next Gen Image Format</h3>
<img src="images/nexgen.jpg" alt="Next Gen" class="img-fluid" title="Next Gen"> <br>
		  
		  
		  		  <p>Next generation image formats were created to deliver top of the line image compression capabilities while maintaining high quality image standards. When designing your website, it is important to use compressed images in order to load your page quickly and smoothly. Adobe photoshop offers solutions to save your images in various next generation formats like JPEG 2000, JPEG XR ad WebP. WebP images are an open source image format designed by Google, these images are considered to be the most compressed, often up to 30% at times. WebP images hold the same capabilities as older image formats like PNG, JPEG anf GIFs. Older browsers have a difficult time displaying these new formats without the help of scripts but thankfully Adobe and several image converters have methods to compress in the classic image formats like PNG and JPEG. Encoding these image formats are especially valuable when your audience views your content from a mobile device with limited data plans like cell or tablet. Some image formats date back to the late '80s and have had improvements over time. Figuring out which methods best serve your audience can make all of the difference in returning users.</p>

<h3>Unused CSS</h3>
<img src="images/unused.jpg" alt="Unused" class="img-fluid" title="Unused"> <br>
		  
		  
		  		  <p>Often when designing a website, you may find yourself using CSS files from other templates but not always using everything within. Unused CSS still consumes data like everything else and can be taxing on content that loads above-the-fold. When dealing with above-the-fold content, we are talking about everything you see visually when a page first loads. Google uses bots to determine the integrity of your page and the above-the-fold content is tested first. Today, many sites are available to determine what content on your website is not being used. Sometimes, when using sites like wordpress or other CMS(content management systems) you can not always remove the CSS or scripts in place when viewing your pages. Learning techniques mentioned in the above paragraphs can prepare you for reducing consumed data and increasing the page load speed. If, for whatever reason, you need to keep your CSS or scripts on your page, it is better to place the content inline within the &#8249;<em>body</em>&#8250; or the &#8249;<em>head</em>&#8250; elements of your page, although it is still best to remove anything unused to begin with. </p>

<h3>Contentful Paint</h3>
<img src="images/contentful.jpg" alt="Contentful" class="img-fluid" title="Contentful"> <br>
		  
		  
		  		  <p>First Contentful Paint measures the lenght of time it takes between going to a page and the actual loading of the first text or image, or DOM elements. A good page will load within the first 2 seconds and generally give you a higher page speed. Other things to note are fonts. Often fonts are large enough is size that a browser struggles to load the font immediatly causing a moment of invisible text. One way to prevent this is to include a system font, or a default font common across all browsers and devices. If your font can not load quickly, a default font is displayed shortly until the custom font is ready. It is also possible to preload fonts in order to reduce invisible text and to improve overall page speed. While your page speed sounds like such a small thing, it's good practice to enforce these things in which we have reviewed over in the paragraphs above. With so much content at our finger tips, it's easy for someone to quickly lose interest in waiting when they believe that their content can be found elsewhere faster. Be sure to do some research and discover which methods are best for the page and audience awaiting your next page.</p>
