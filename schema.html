	<h3>Schema Markup</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<img src="images/schema.jpg" alt="Schema Page" class="img-fluid" title="Schema Page"> <br><br>

		  
		  
	  		    <p>The Google search engine is the #1 used search tool today. When trying to search for content, Google tools stand out above the rest. From reviews, breadcrumbs, recipes, software and many other schema types, google tries to deliver the most accurate and reliable listings geared towards your search terms. Below we will list a few visually appealing markups that enhance your audience ability to see your listing. For these examples, we will refer to the instructions found on the Google structured data page found <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/product" title="Markup">here</a>.<br>
              <br>

                  </a><img src="images/console.jpg" alt="Search Console" class="img-fluid" title="Search Console"><br>
<br>
					You can gain access to many tools from Google by joining the Google Search Console. These tools help test your markup, allow you to apply rich data and make yourself aware of any errors found within your site. These tools can be found <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about" title="Search Console">here</a>.<br>

<h3>Reviews and Ratings </h3>
<img src="images/star-schema.jpg" alt="Reviews" class="img-fluid" title="Reviews"> <br>
		  
		  
		  		  <p>The most notable markup you can apply to a page to gain recognition would be the use of ratings or reviews. When looking for a business or service, you want to ensure that the people you hire or plan to work with are trusted by the community. With this in mind, it helps to apply the proper schema markup for the situation. Not every person finding your online profiles uses Facebook or Yelp, which strictly apply reviews and ratings like the picture above to give you better knowlege of who you're about to interact with. Schema markup is not governed by Google and is used by other search engines like Bing and Yahoo. There is no guarantee that search engines will apply these to your listings. The review seen above took 3 years before Google applied it to my listing, and only after I had 10 reviews in total. Other engines like Bing picked up my markup after their bot crawled my pages the next day. Bing offers a markup tester, not nearly at the quality of Google, but it is important to be available on all platforms, as some people who use Facebook won't be on Twitter, for instance. People will notice the reviews and the yellow stars before reading anything else on page, which it's designed to do.</p>

<h3>Breadcrumbs</h3>
<img src="images/breadcrumb-schema.jpg" alt="Breadcrumbs" class="img-fluid" title="Breadcrumbs"> <br>
		  
		  
		  		  <p>Another method you can apply to your listings are breadcrumbs. When you pages deal with multiple points of interest, it helps to have breadcrumbs to easily drive users close to the content they're looking for. In the example above, I run a popular modding gaming site, primarily for the game Spore. With my breadcrumbs enabled, users can find my listing and have the option to better refine what they were looking for before clicking the listing. I've offered in my breadcrumbs the option to goto the main page, the main downloadbale content page, our tools and patches pages or our bug reporting page. I find this to be extremely helpful for our users. My audience in this case happens to be the 8-17 year old demographic, mainly kids looking for new options for their old games. While this particular method nor the ratings markup will have a heavy influence on the rank of your site, it will improve functonality and ultimately keep users returning due to usability and ubiquity. Google picks up on these trends and creates breadcrumbs for areas of your site based on the traffic rate and the pages that are receiving the most hits thanks to the creative algorithms.</p>
